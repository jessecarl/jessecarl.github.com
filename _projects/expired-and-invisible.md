Before setting out on the road, I had a salaried position developing sites for
destination marketing organizations. Most of my work was on the back-end, but I
was often called in to tackle some of the more interesting front-end issues.

I built out an image manipulation library to automatically add perspective to
images, customizable bobble-head animations, social media integrations,
specialized search tools, and more. With such a fast-moving industry, much of
the work I did has been replaced as the clients have updated their sites and
tools.

As an interesting side note, many of the cities I had the chance to play in
as a musician were cities I had built websites for. It was a strange sensation
of familiarity.
