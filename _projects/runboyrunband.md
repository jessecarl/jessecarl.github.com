I built this application for the band that was my primary occupation for a few
years. Because I had near-total freedom, the Run Boy Run website became a
testbed for my approach to web development.<!--more-->

I built the site in [Go](http://golang.org), deployed to
[Heroku](http://heroku.com), organized content according to volatility,
structured data to match the content, and curated content according to the
explicit goals of the band. While some of the code for the site is already
released as my open source [gobase](http://github.com/lazyengineering/gobase)
project, Iâ€™m in the process now of porting all the band-specific components
to another open source project.
