The Run Boy Run website was built around the explicit goals and needs of the
band: increase album sales, increase concert attendance, and increase concert
bookings. Everything I included on the site was in service to one or more of
those core goals. As we continue looking at this project, keep those goals in
mind.<!--more-->

###Designed for the Users

With those core goals in mind, I took note of who would be using the site. We
divided the key users into three groups, each with potential to serve our goals:

* Fans – buying albums and attending concerts
* Press – publishing materials that serve to promote the band
* Talent Buyers – booking the band for concerts

Knowing what each of these groups would be looking for was key in developing an
effective website. After careful consideration and some helpful feedback from
our booking and PR people, we were able to optimize the site for these core sets
of users.

###Everything has a purpose

Filtering everything through our goals and our users resulted in a focused site.
Let’s take a minute to look at some of the elements of the site, and how they
meet the needs of the users and serve our goals.

####Music

The music page is simple. It lists every album the band has for sale with large
artwork, a short description, quotes endorsing the album, audio streaming, and
a link to buy it immediately. All three of the major goals, and all three key
users are served here. The fans are introduced to the product through the audio
streaming, encouraged to buy the product by notable quotes, descriptions, and
compelling artwork, and given the opportunity to buy the album. The press are
provided with artwork, quotes, and a description they can use without having to
search or scan. The talent buyers, like the fans, are introduced to the product
and shown key endorsements.

There is nothing particularly special or unique about this music page. It is
just like nearly every other music page for nearly every band with a website.
The only difference between this one and most others is that the Run Boy Run
music page was intentional rather than accidental, and that is important.

####Shows

The shows page is also fairly simple, and fairly common. Included on the page
is a section listing upcoming concerts and a section listing past concerts.
The upcoming concerts guide fans to attend, give the press something to promote,
and show talent buyers what their peers think of the band. Past shows let fans,
the press, and talent buyers see how the band has grown, and what level of show
they can expect.
