The [Run Boy Run website](/projects/runboyrunband/) was built around the
explicit goals and needs of the band: increase album sales, increase concert
attendance, and increase concert bookings. Everything I included on the site was
in service to one or more of those core goals. As we continue looking at this
project, keep those goals in mind.<!--more-->

### Designed for the Users

With those core goals in mind, I took note of who would be using the site. We
divided the key users into three groups, each with potential to serve our goals:

- Fans – buying albums and attending concerts
- Press – publishing materials that serve to promote the band
- Talent Buyers – booking the band for concerts

Knowing what each of these groups would be looking for was key in developing an
effective website. After careful consideration and some helpful feedback from
our booking and PR people, we were able to optimize the site for these core sets
of users.

### Everything has a purpose

Filtering everything through our goals and our users resulted in a focused site.
Let’s take a minute to look at some of the elements of the site, and how they
meet the needs of the users and serve our goals.

#### Home

The home page was left with very little on it. Because every user first engages
with the site on the home page, the story we tell here must be one that every
user is a part of. If we make a home page that is optimized for existing talent
buyers whose needs are centered around promotion for shows they already have
under contract, it might be overwhelming for a new potential fan just wanting to
find out more about this band. And, if we do the reverse, the talent buyer may
find it difficult to do her best work for the band.

The primary purpose of the home page is to define the brand. Let’s define the
brand as the sum of everything you communicate about who you are. This is often
underpinned and expressed through a cohesive set of visual design patterns that
include colors, typefaces, logos. The brand is *not* those assets any more than
a home is an address.

On the home page, we have a large color photo of the band, a short elevator
pitch or teaser, the band name, and a logo. The only other thing we put on this
home page is an occasional modal dialog with big news the band wants to share
with everybody. I designed the big news to be shown once for any person, then
never shown again, and to only show a single big news item for each page load.
Future band websites may include an archive of big news items, but I doubt they
will be accessed very often.

#### Music

The music page is simple. It lists every album the band has for sale with large
artwork, a short description, quotes endorsing the album, audio streaming, and
a link to buy it immediately. All three of the major goals, and all three key
users are served here. The fans are introduced to the product through the audio
streaming, encouraged to buy the product by notable quotes, descriptions, and
compelling artwork, and given the opportunity to buy the album. The press are
provided with artwork, quotes, and a description they can use without having to
search or scan. The talent buyers, like the fans, are introduced to the product
and shown key endorsements.

There is nothing particularly special or unique about this music page. It is
just like nearly every other music page for nearly every band with a website.
The only difference between this one and most others is that the Run Boy Run
music page was intentional rather than accidental, and that is important.

#### Shows

The shows page is also fairly simple, and fairly common. Included on the page
is a section listing upcoming concerts and a section listing past concerts.
The upcoming concerts guide fans to attend, give the press something to promote,
and show talent buyers what their peers think of the band. Past shows let fans,
the press, and talent buyers see how the band has grown, and what level of show
they can expect.

#### About

The about page paints a picture of who the band is. Unlike the home page, that
seeks to express the brand, the about page is explicit. A long form bio, photos
of each band member with name and instruments, and a selection of press quotes
(with links to the original articles for reference). This page is particularly
geared towards increasing concert bookings and attendance. Press and talent
buyers can use the bio and the press quotes in materials that promote concert
attendance. Talent buyers, eager to find a band with a story they can sell, are
going to learn if this band has that story in the bio. Fans who are curious
about the upcoming show in their area will want to know more about the band
before they spend money to see them. The headshots are helpful for connecting
real faces to the names in the bio and the bodies on the stage. They are not
strictly needed, but they can serve to amplify the interaction.

#### Contact

The contact page is exactly what it sounds like. If people need to contact the
band or any of the people who represent the band, they find exactly the
information they need on the contact page. If it’s a fan who wants to say
thank you for a great show, a talent buyer who wants to book their festival, or
a journalist who wants to conduct an interview for the local weekly before the
show, they will find exactly who they need to contact and exactly how to contact
them.

#### Photos

The photos page, while some fans might take a look, is primarily a resource for
press and talent buyers. By providing several full resolution images that are
high quality, members of the press do not have to scramble to find pictures for
articles and talent buyers will be less tempted to use the wrong graphics in
promotional materials (some will *always* use the wrong graphics, no matter what
you do). The photos in collection also serve to reinforce the brand visually.

#### Videos

Probably the least used page, but still useful. The videos page shows a selection
of videos of the band. This includes live concert footage, in studio performances,
and official music videos. This page primarily serves talent buyers, and primarily
in booking more concerts. Most talent buyers want to know what they are buying, so
any high quality video of high quality live performance can be very effective in
meeting goals here.

### TL;DR

> Organize your website around your business goals to serve the needs of your
> users. You may see something you like on another site, but unless it can be
> aimed at your goals and targets your users, it is a complete waste of time
> and money. That doesn’t mean you don’t use those cool ideas, but it does
> mean you think through them before you build.
