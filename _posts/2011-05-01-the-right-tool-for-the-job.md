I&#8217;m a firm believer in the aphorism above. So, in that spirit, I will now expose the process I used in choosing the tools for my project. At the risk of offending language zealots, I will be perfectly blunt; I can&#8217;t stand some of these languages, and I only put them here to belittle them.<!--more-->

##Part I: Language

Choosing a language is a pretty important part of this process. Here&#8217;s the rundown on my choices.

###[C][C]

Yeah, I didn&#8217;t really consider this, but it is worth noting. C is one of my favorite languages of all time, but it seems ill suited to this problem. I would have too much overhead to get it off the ground.

###[C++][Cplusplus]

Just like C, this would just carry too much overhead.

###[Java][Java]

Honestly, I&#8217;m not a huge Java fan. It is a little too verbose for me. The ideas behind the language were nothing short of genius, but actually using it &#8211; especially in a case like this one &#8211; is just a pain.

###[C#][Csharp]

Ha.

###[PHP][PHP]

I have quite a bit of experience with PHP, and I find it to be a decent language. That being said, I have found it to be a bit disorganized; the language has gotten a lot better over the years, but it still doesn&#8217;t feel like much more than a toy.

###[ColdFusion][ColdFusion]

This is what I work in every day at my job, and I can&#8217;t stand it (sorry, work friends, but you already knew I feel this way). ColdFusion makes Java look terse and PHP look clean and organized.

###[Haskell][Haskell]

This would be overkill on so many levels. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m quite nerdy enough to start building simple web applications in a CS trendy language like Haskell.

###[Ruby][Ruby]
Tempting, but having actual rockstar aspirations makes the stereotypes here all too real. Not to mention all the other hipster symptoms I&#8217;m too often diagnosed with. Maybe for another project with less inherent hipster vibe.

###[node.js (JavaScript)][Node]

I&#8217;ve heard good things about node.js, and I do enjoy JavaScript. JavaScript without DOM might be a fun adventure. I do enjoy functions as first-class objects and closures, but I don&#8217;t really need the event-driven I/O. Maybe another project.

###[Go][Go]

Go is just plain awesome. The only thing preventing me from using Go for this is that I could only choose one. If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to try out this language, do.

###[Python][Python]

Clean, terse, powerful, and stable&#8230; With a vast amount of resources available, and some of the most flexible, powerful frameworks, this was nearly a no-brainer. Plus, I just wanted to learn it.
