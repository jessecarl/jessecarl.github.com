##Source Control

In [part 1](/2011/05/01/the-right-tool-for-job.html), I explored language
choice; in [part 2](/2011/05/10/the-right-tool-for-job-part-2.html), I explored
framework choice; today, I will briefly discuss source control. I will be using
[Git](http://git-scm.com/). The choice was clear. I don&#8217;t feel like going
over all of the reasons why [Git is better than](http://whygitisbetterthanx.com/)
other options. I prefer to let [other people](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8)
talk about it.

With that square, I have done the only logical thing to do: start a
[new project](http://jessecarl.github.io/pyFidelity/) on [GitHub](http://github.com/).
The project is nothing but an initial build of a [Pylons](http://pylonsproject.org/)
project.

I have a confession to make. These last three posts have been a little bit deceptive.
I didn&#8217;t really make my tool selections in the way that I&#8217;ve outlined.
I knew these tools before I knew my project. In fact, I selected my project to
fit these tools. I could do this because the problem of organizing my record
collection is not important, and I am leaving myself open to change my tools as
my needs change. Next post, I will actually be making a decision on my data store.
Any suggestions?
